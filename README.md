# Siddha Medicine Portal & Chatbot

This project is a web application dedicated to providing information about traditional Siddha medicine. It features a modern, user-friendly frontend and a powerful backend powered by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot. The chatbot can answer user questions about diseases, symptoms, and remedies based on a knowledge base derived from Ministry of AYUSH-aligned information.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **RAG Chatbot**: An intelligent chatbot that uses a knowledge base (`cleaned_chatbot.csv`) to provide accurate and context-aware answers.
-   **Conversational Memory**: The chatbot remembers the context of the conversation for natural follow-up questions.
-   **Dynamic Formatting**: The chatbot's responses are formatted using Markdown for better readability (e.g., bold text, bullet points).
